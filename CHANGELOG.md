## Linux workstation security checklist

- add warning that attackers routinely brute-force simple passphrases
- recommend switching to Wayland
- Replace browser-in-VM recommendation with firejail-separated profiles
  instead
- List NitroKey in addition to Yubikey
- Add recommendation to use Fido U2F for services supporting it
- Add SubgraphOS alongside QubesOS (though SubgraphOS is still in alpha)
- Not adding Flatpak/Snappy yet, as the list of supported apps is pretty pithy
